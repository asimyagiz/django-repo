# Getting started with Django on Devtron

This code has been taken from [google repo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples)

This repository is an example of how to run a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) 
app on [Devtron](https://devtron.ai). It uses the
[Writing your first Django app](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial01/)
Polls application (parts 1 and 2) as the example app to deploy. From here on
out, we refer to this app as the 'polls' application.


# Tutorial
See our [Django on Container Engine](https://docs.devtron.ai/docs/use-cases/connect-django-with-mysql-database/) tutorial for instructions for setting up and deploying this sample application on Devtron.
